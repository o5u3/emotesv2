Hello, I'm currently working on Free Emotes v2. In-case you're wondering what this Free Emotes project is for, it allows you to use emotes from the Roblox catalog for FREE. Luckily for v2 there'll be more stuff you can do. This README is in this repository to inform you that I'm working on v2, meaning I will no longer update v1. If you'd like to get v2 before it gets released to YouTube join our official discord server, discord.gg/tU87b6w (v2 isn't released yet)

Thanks for reading.
